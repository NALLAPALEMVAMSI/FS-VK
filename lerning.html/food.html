  2.For Life energy
</h2>
<p><h4>
<ul>
    <li>Life is dependent on the <mark> energy generated</mark> inside the body. Food is the only source of this vital energy for the body.</li>
<li>Our body functions by utilizing the energy from food. Food acts as fuel to generate energy in the<mark> mitochondria</mark>.</li>
  <li>  Glucose from the food interacts with the oxygen we breathe.</li>
 <li> This leads to a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which produces energy in the form of ATP.</li>
 <li> Carbon dioxide and water molecules are formed as bye products of the above mechanism.</li></p></h4>
</ul>
<h2>
    3.For body, growth and maintenance
</h2>
<p><h4>
    <ul>
  <li> During childhood, food helps in the growth of the body.</li>
  <li> The body structures like the bones and tissues need sufficient protein, calcium and other nutrients for growth.</li>
  <li> These are provided through food.</li>
  <li> In the later years, the food helps in maintenance of the weight</li>
  <li> Hence, the bodyweight is directly proportional to food intake. To maintain a healthy weight having regular food is essential.</li>
  <li> Food gives shape and form to the body.</li>
  <li> The amino acids from the food act to build body cells and other tissues to maintain shape and function.</li>

    </ul>
</h4></p>
<h2>
 4.For Bodybuilding
</h2>
<p><h4>
<ul>
 <li>  Those who go to the gym and other strenuous exercise for bodybuilding need protein.</li>
<li>   The growth of muscle tissue induced by workouts requires sufficient food.</li>

 <li>   For this, pulses, milk, egg, and meat are recommended.</li>
</ul>
</h4></p>
<h2>
 5. For Health
</h2>
<h4><p>
<ul>
 <li>    Some food materials act as supplements of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, etc.</li>
 <li>    If nutrient-rich food is taken, the need for certain medicine will not arise.</li>
 <li>   So food acts as a medicine if taken in proper form and right amounts.</li>
 <li>    In few cases, food is aid in curing. For instance, when one is wounded, if he eats sufficient food, his immunity and healing boosts up, and one feels relieved from injury faster.</li><br>
 <b style="color: blue;">Nutrition deficiency diseases</b> like the kwashiorkor, ostelomalacia are indicators of role of food in health.<br><br>
the case of acidity, one of the best techniques to overcome acidity is to have a small quantity of food at frequent short intervals. <br>

   <li>    Food gives strength to the body to manage the drug, respond and build immunity.</li>
 <li>    Most drugs are<strong style="color:darkorange;"> metabolized in the liver</strong> or other organs by the action of enzymes.</li>
 <li>     These enzymes are made of proteins that are provided by food.</li>
<li>    Without food, drugs fail to overcome some diseases like tuberculosis, sunstroke, gastric ulcers, skin diseases, muscle pains, etc.</li>
  <li>   Many oil-soluble drugs get absorbed well in the presence of fatty food etc.</li>
 <li>   Lack of sufficient diet along with the administration of drugs leads to many problems like drug accumulation, development of resistance to the drug by microbes, etc.</li>
<li>   Food helps generate sufficient enzymes in the liver to metabolize the toxic drugs.</li>
 <li>   Thus on metabolism, drugs become more water-soluble and get excreted from urine.</li>
<li>  It also helps develop antibodies and<strong style="color:darkorange;"> white blood cells</strong> develop resistance to disease-causing microbes.</li>
